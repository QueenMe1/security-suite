# HOW I BUILT A PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER FROM SCRATCH : PROTECTING YOUR DATA STARTS HERE

## Introduction
Passwords are the first line of defense in cybersecurity, but weak passwords are still one of the biggest threat today. In this project, I built a Password Strength Checker using python to help people undestand how secure their passwords really are.

## Project Overview
This tool check for:
    - Minimum Password Length
    - Uppercase and Lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Special Characters
    - Common Password Pattern

    It gives instant feedback: Weak, Medium, or Strong.

## How I Built It
I used the Python's regex library to validate passwords and compared inputs to a list of commonly used passwords.

### Key Features:
    - Simple text-based interface
    - Customizable password blacklist (list of commonly used passwords)
    - Easy to expand with more security features

### Challenges I Faced:
    - Validating edge cases
    - Creating a efficient check for common passwords
    - Making this toole user-friendly

## What's Next
    - Adding a GUI 
    - Expanding this into a full security suite
