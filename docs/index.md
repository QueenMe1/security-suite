 HOW I BUILT A PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER FROM SCRATCH : PROTECTING YOUR DATA STARTS HERE
 ----------------------

## 📢 Introduction
Passwords are the first line of defense in cybersecurity, but weak passwords are still one of the biggest threat today. In this project, I built a Password Strength Checker using python to help people undestand how secure their passwords really are.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This tool check for:

    - Minimum Password Length.
    - Uppercase and Lowercase letters.
    - Numbers.
    - Special Characters.
    - Common Password Pattern.

    It gives instant feedback: Weak, Medium, or Strong.

## 👩🏽‍💻 How I Built It
I used the Python's regex library to validate passwords and compared inputs to a list of commonly used passwords.

### 🔑 Key Features:
    - Simple text-based interface.
    - Customizable password blacklist (list of commonly used passwords).
    - Easy to expand with more security features.

### ⚙️ Challenges I Faced:
    - Validating edge cases.
    - Creating a efficient check for common passwords.
    - Making this tool user-friendly.

### 🎯 What I Learned
This project taught me about password complexity, brute-force risks, and defensive cybersecurity concepts.

## What's Next
    - Adding a GUI.
    - Expanding this into a full security suite.
